# SantaCarol
Behold my amazing project, a fun little application that draws Santa to the beat of Carol of the Bells
All my code is under the src folder, everything else is just Eclipse stuff

This was made in Eclipse with Java 12 so you might want to have that set up if you want to download my application for whatever crazy reason

Feel free to copy and make changes to my code as you wish, no credit needed, it's not like I'm gonna make a million dollars out of this am I right?
